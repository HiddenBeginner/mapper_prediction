# A Prediction Algorithm with the Mapper Method Based on DBSCAN and Giotto-TDA
Author's implementation of "A Prediction Algorithm with the Mapper Method Based on DBSCAN and Giotto-TDA". 
Our implmentation builds upon [Giotto-TDA's Mapper implementation](https://github.com/giotto-ai/giotto-tda/tree/master/gtda/mapper) and [Sciikit-learng's DBSCAN implementation](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/main/sklearn/cluster/_dbscan.py#L175).
All figures and experimental results in the paper are presented in `Examples.ipynb` and `Fraud_detection.ipynb`. 
To run `Fraud_detection.ipynb`, please download the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and place the `creditcard.csv` file in the `./data` directory.
Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from the experiment is provided at [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
